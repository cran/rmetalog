#' Fish size measurements from the Pacific Northwest.
#'
#' Example data set of fish size measurements from the Pacific Northwest, used
#' for illustrating the flexibility of the metalog distribution. This data set
#' is bi-modal because the fish contain two different populations, one salt and
#' two salt runs. The two salt, fish that have gone back to the ocean twice, are
#' larger.
